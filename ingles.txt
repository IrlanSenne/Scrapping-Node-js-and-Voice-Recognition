 First sorry because my reading and writing in english are better than my speaking

Today I woke up at 8:15, went to the market to buy bread and had breakfast.

 Ah, I bought pastel de nata too, 

 I love all typical Portuguese foods,for example:  berlin ball, francesinha etc.
 
So I'm here for this interview.
  
 After I'll study... in this carrer the studies don't stop, that's all
